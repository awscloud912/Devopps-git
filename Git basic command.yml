

Here's a general overview of the GitHub workflow:

1. Create a repository: A developer creates a repository (repo) on GitHub to store their project's code.

2. Clone the repository: The developer clones the repository to their local machine using the command git clone.

3. Make changes: The developer makes changes to the code, adds new files, or modifies existing ones.

4. Commit changes: The developer commits their changes to their local repository using git commit and includes a commit message describing the changes.

5. Push changes: The developer pushes their committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub using git push.

6. Create a pull request: The developer creates a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch (usually "main" or "master").

7. Review and approve: Collaborators review the pull request, make comments, and approve or request changes.

8. Merge pull request: The pull request is merged into the main branch.

9. Deploy: The updated code is deployed to a production environment.

10. git branch -M main: This command is used to rename the current branch to "main". The -M option is a shortcut for --move --force, 
                        which allows you to rename the branch even if there is already a branch with the target name.

11. git remote -v: The git remote -v command displays the current remote repositories associated with your local Git repository along with their URLs.

12. git remote remove origin: This command removes the remote named origin from your local Git repository.

13. git fetch origin: When you run this command you are instructing Git to retrieve updates from the remote repository named origin.

14. git clone: This commands  command is used to create a copy of an existing Git repository. It clones the entire repository, including all of its history, branches, 
               and tags, to your local machine
